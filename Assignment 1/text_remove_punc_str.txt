are we open scienceacknowledgments the 2019 predicting media memorability tasktask descriptionthis task focuses on the problem of predicting how memorable a video is to viewers it requires participants to automatically predict memorability scores for videos that reflect the probability a video will be remembered task participants are provided with an extensive dataset of videos that are accompanied by memorability annotations as well as preextracted stateoftheart visual features the ground truth has been collected through recognition tests and thus results from objective measurement of memory performance participants will be required to train computational models capable of inferring video memorability from visual content optionally descriptive titles attached to the videos may be used models will be evaluated through standard evaluation metrics used in ranking tasks spearman ’ s rank correlation the data set used in 2019 is the same as in 2018 2018 ’ s testset ground truth data has not been released this year the task focuses on understanding the patterns in the data and improving the ability of algorithms to capture those patternstask motivation and backgroundthe motivation for the task is the growth over recent years in the amount of multimedia content shared and consumed via online platforms enhancing the usefulness of multimedia requires new ways to organize–in particular to recommend and retrieve–digital content like other aspects related to video relevance such as aesthetics or interestingness memorability can be regarded as useful to help make a choice between competing videos effective memorability prediction models will also push forward the semantic understanding of multimedia content by putting human cognition and perception at the center of the multimedia analysisa number of different application areas benefit from deeper understanding of what makes some videos memorable and others less so these areas include recommendation and retrieval in online platforms already mentioned but also advertising filmmaking and education it is increasingly important to understand what makes videos memorable in order to keep the use of automatic processing techniques evenhanded applications can make use of information about predicted memorability but it is important to understand memorability well enough to be able to avoid systems that are hyperoptimized to viewer responses target groupresearchers will find this task interesting if they work in the areas of human perception and the impact of multimedia on perception such as image and video interestingness memorability attractiveness aesthetics prediction event detection multimedia affect and perceptual analysis multimedia content analysis machine learning though not limited to datathe dataset is composed of 10000 soundless short videos extracted from raw footage used by professionals when creating content and in particular commercials each video consists of a coherent unit in terms of meaning and is associated with two scores of memorability that refer to its probability to be remembered after two different durations of memory retention the videos are shared under creative commons licenses that allow their redistribution they come with a set of preextracted features such as dense sift hog descriptors lbp gist color histogram mfcc fc7 layer from alexnet c3d features etcground truth and evaluationeach video consists of a coherent unit in terms of meaning and is associated with two scores of memorability that refer to its probability to be remembered after two different durations of memory retention memorability has been measured using recognition tests ie through an objective measure a few minutes after the memorization of the videos and then 24 to 72 hours laterthe outputs of the prediction models – ie the predicted memorability scores for the videos – will be compared with ground truth memorability scores using classic evaluation metrics eg spearman ’ s rank correlation recommended reading 1 romain cohendet clairehélène demarty ngoc q k duong mats sjöberg bogdan ionescu thanhtoan do 2018 mediaeval 2018 predicting
